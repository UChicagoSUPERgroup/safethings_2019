# When Smart Devices Are Stupid: Negative Experiences Using Home Smart Devices

This repository is the anonymized survey data for the paper "When Smart Devices Are Stupid: Negative Experiences Using Home Smart Devices", which will appear in Safethings 2019. The dataset only consists of responses from participants who have explicitly given us the permission to release the data for future research. 

# Consent

In the survey, we explicitly placed a question that asked for permission from the participants if we could release their responses for future research. The consent is considered as given only when the participants manually click on "Yes" to the question. Any responses from participants who didn't click on "Yes" to the question are excluded from the released dataset. 

73 out of 75 participants opted-in to the data release and the remaining 2 participants' responses are not included. 

# File Description
