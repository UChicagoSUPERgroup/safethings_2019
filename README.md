# When Smart Devices Are Stupid: Negative Experiences Using Home Smart Devices

This repository contains the anonymized survey data for the paper "When Smart Devices Are Stupid: Negative Experiences Using Home Smart Devices," which will appear in Safethings 2019. The dataset only consists of responses from participants who have explicitly given us permission to release the data for future research. 

# Consent

In the survey, we explicitly asked participants whether we could release their responses for future research. We only considered consent to be given if participants manually clicked on "Yes" to the question. Any responses from participants who didn't click on "Yes" to the question are excluded from the released dataset. 

73 out of 75 participants opted-in to the data release and the remaining 2 participants' responses are not included. 

# File Description

## valid_responses.csv

The `valid_responses.csv` file contains the data that we actually analyzed in the paper. There should be responses from 70 participants in total. The empty rows in the file are either ineffective responses (3 participants) or responses from participants who opted out of the data release (2 participants).

The first row consists of the questions we asked in the survey, and the rest are participants' responses.
