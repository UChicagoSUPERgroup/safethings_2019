1194	Yes	Internet-connected camera							 DRM schemes							Yes	"Routers and modems (and router-modem combos) are essentially little computers. For the most part, they can run 24/7 without a problem, but the longer they stay on without a break, the more likely they'll develop software errors. Errors that can cause a disconnection.

It may be a cliche, but when your internet stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your equipment."

Then wait about 30 seconds, and plug them back in: first the modem, then the router.
Wait a few minutes for them to completely power back on. If your equipment had encountered an error, the restart should fix it and your internet should be back up."				Male	25 - 34	Professional degree	Yes
