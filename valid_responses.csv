Yes,,,,Internet-connected light,,,,,,,Philips Hue,,,,Yes,"It doesn't happen often but when it does, we never figure out what caused it, and it eventually goes back to normal. What happens is that once in a while, it will become impossible to activate or control one of the sets of lights we have. We will get a message stating that the network is not connected to the room we want to activate, or something to that effect. It can last for an evening, or just an hour and generally things go back to normal relatively fast, but while the problem is there, it's impossible to operate the lights in the specific location, which is obviously a drag.",,,,No,,No,,"I can certainly imagine them not working properly, like any other device.

I mean how many people in the general population are able to code? Very few.

It was hot and I wanted it to be cool but the thermostat would always set back to 75 degrees automatically. It was very frustrating.,,,,I have never done either.,,,,,,I can imagine that writing rules for internet-connected household devices would be inconvenient at times like operating when you didn't want the device to operate or a camera detecting motion and going off when you were simply trying to walk around your own home. I imagine that the rules would work when you wanted them too but also work at inconvenient times. ,No,,Yes,They had a smart robot vacuum and it would detect a certain area of the floor as an object and wouldn't vacuum it at all which was inconvenient for them since they wanted the vacuum to vacuum the whole house. ,,Female,18 - 24,4 year degree,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Things that should never happen,"No, I believe it should be true no matter what.",,I expect most people would want this exactly as written

If the power went out, this would certainly cause difficulties, because you may no longer be able to control the devices in question.",Yes,"My internet connected camera frequently has pop-up reminders for firmware updates, which can be annoying and frustrating, because I usually just want to check my camera, and not have to download updates for it.
When I want to use my internet connected camera via my smartphone, but I am not somewhere that has WiFi or 4G service, I am unable to access the camera.
The sound quality of the two-way audio on my internet connected camera is somewhat low quality, and delayed by a few seconds, so it is hard to actually carry on a meaningful conversation using it.",,,,I have never done either.,,,,,,"I could imagine a number of difficulties trying to do this. First, I am not an expert in coding, and have a minimal amount of experience writing code or programming, though I understand a few basic concepts. If I didn't write the code just right, the commands would probably not work, but I wouldn't necessarily be able to figure out why or which part of the code contained an error. It might be difficult to successfully write code and implement it on my devices. Additionally, I don't even know if this is possible with the devices I own, which would obviously be an issue.",No,,No,,"There are a huge amount of difficulties someone might have given all the different internet-connected devices that exist, way more than I could ever list here.
